## 0. Git Basics
At first I listened first two weeks of [Introduction to Git and Github](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github).
The course was useful and gave me an understanding of Git Basics. In addition to this I watched Bogdan Stashchuk's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O00FTZDxD0o&t=13566s&ab_channel=BogdanStashchuk) about Git, which gave me good understanding how Git Areas work on basic level.

Than I passed all the levels on [learngitbranching.js.org](learngitbranching.js.org). It wasn't too difficultб but it took me some time. The game gives good visual presentation of branches.

Than I read about markdown and completed [Communicating Using Markdown](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown) course from Github.

However, I had some problems when I sent pull-request to [mock-repo](https://github.com/Kottans/mock-repo).

## Linux CLI and HTTP
Completed [Linux Tutorial Introduction](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/) course. It was really cool, I liked it a lot! Now I know main Linux commands.

Than I read this article about HTTP: [Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177) and [Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155). To be honest I found this article a quite complicated and confusing.
