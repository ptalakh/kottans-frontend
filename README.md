## 0. Git Basics
At first I listened first two weeks of [Introduction to Git and Github](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github).
The course was useful and gave me an understanding of Git Basics. In addition to this I watched Bogdan Stashchuk's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O00FTZDxD0o&t=13566s&ab_channel=BogdanStashchuk) about Git, which gave me good understanding how Git Areas work on basic level.

Than I passed all the levels on [learngitbranching.js.org](learngitbranching.js.org). It wasn't too difficultÐ± but it took me some time. The game gives good visual presentation of branches.

Than I read about markdown and completed [Communicating Using Markdown](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown) course from Github.

However, I had some problems when I sent pull-request to [mock-repo](https://github.com/Kottans/mock-repo).

## 1. Linux CLI and HTTP
Completed [Linux Tutorial Introduction](https://linuxsurvival.com/linux-tutorial-introduction/) course. It was really cool, I liked it a lot! Now I know main Linux commands.

Than I read this article about HTTP: [Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177) and [Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/uk/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155). To be honest I found this article a quite complicated and confusing.

## 2. VCS (hello gitty), GitHub and Collaboration
Listened last two weeks of [Introduction to Git and Github](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github). Learned a lot of information about working with remote repositories, solving conflicts and collaborating with other developers. All the material was well presented, such as before. Also the practical examples were shown very well, there was a feeling like it was shown a work on the real project.

Since I have passed all the levels before, I have nothing more to say about [learngitbranching.js.org](learngitbranching.js.org).

Summing up the "General" module, I think that it would be more understandable for me, as for person who have never used Git and the Command Line before, if the "Linux CLI and HTTP" topic went first, because it gives the concept of how to work with the Command Line. As the example, I had to use the "cd" command to enter the "mock-repo" when I needed to create a pull-request. Also I think it would be well if creating a pull-request task was in topic called "VCS (hello gitty), GitHub and Collaboration" because it's about working with remote repos and some things I wanted to know, when I was creating a pull-request.

Well, that's all for now, so I will move onðŸ˜º
